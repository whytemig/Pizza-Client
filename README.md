# Readi Pizza

Readi Pizza was developed for a local pizza client that aquire their own API. They requested the functionality, but i had free range on the layout and color scheme as long as it fit the theme of their local building. This web application was developed in mind on increasing customers satisfaction with orders, prices, availability of items on the menu and delivery time.
